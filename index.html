<div class="nintendo">
<h2>Nintendo</h2>
<p>On September 23, 1889 a transitional company was created. It wasn't until 1983 when they released their first gaming experience. Nintendo has sold over 4.4 billion games and over 696 million hardware units, these are some pretty big numbers, what else would you expect for being around for so long?</p>

<h2>Playstation</h2>
<p>When it comes to Playstation you would think it was it's own company, right? Well, not exactly. Nintendo actually works with Sony out of Japan and it was released to the public on December 3rd 1994 in Japan. Playstation was not actually released in the United States until September 9th 1995.</p>

<h2>Atari</h2>
<p>Now here is a gaming console we all remember, good ol' Atari. Even though they released many classics in the 1970's believe it or not there were earlier video games, as early as the 1950's, Atari basically mastered them and made them a bit more entertaining.</p>
